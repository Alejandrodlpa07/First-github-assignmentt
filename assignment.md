# Count me out by Kendrick Lamar 
### Lyrics 
We may not know which way to go
On this dark road
(Mr. Duckworth)
All of these hoes make it difficult
Session ten, breakthrough
One of these lives, I'ma make things right
With the wrongs I've done, that's one of you now
With the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight
Rain on me, put the blame on me
Got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
Got six magazines that's aimed at me
Done every magazine, what's fame to me? (And I'm trippin' and fallin')
It's a game to me, where the bedroom at?
Sleep, I ain't had affairs with that
What's fair when the hearts and the words don't reach?
What's fair when the money don't take things back?
It's rare when somebody take your dreams back? (And I'm trippin' and fallin')
I care too much, wanna share too much
In my head too much, I shut down too
I ain't there too much, I'm a complex soul
They layered me up, then broke me down
And moralities dust, I lack in trust (and I'm trippin' and fallin')
This time around, I trust myself
Please everybody else but myself
All else fails, I was myself
Out done fear, out done myself
This year, you better one yourself (and I'm trippin' and fallin')
Masks on the babies, mask on an opp
Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shot
But a mask won't hide who you are inside
Look around, the realities carved in the lies
Wipe my ego, dodge my pride (and I'm trippin' and fallin')
Look myself in the mirror
Amityville, I ain't seen nothin' scarier
I fought like a pit bull terrier, blood I shed could fill up aquariums
Tell my angels, "Carry 'em" (and I'm trippin' and fallin')
Every emotion been deprived
Even my strong points couldn't survive
If I didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg
I love when you count me out (huh)
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (wah, woo, ooh)
I love when you count me out
Fuck it up, fuck it up
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up
How you gon' win my trust when the lies run deep? (Wah, woo, wah)
How you gon' bend your love when the bad don't sleep? (Sheeesh)
Beep, beep, crash our feelings in the middle of the street (vroom, vroom)
Fuck it up, fuck it up
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (huh, huh)
When you was at your lowest, tell me where the hoes was at?
When you was at your lowest, tell me where the bros was at?
Three-thirty in the mornin', scroll through the call log (huh, huh, huh, huh)
Ain't nobody but the mirror lookin' for the fall off (Brrt)
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)
My name is in your mouth, shoo, shoo
It's gon' take more than pride to stop
Call 9-1-1, I caught a body
Sun up now, yesterday is fadin'
Healing's only 'bout a mile away
Let me tell you 'bout the women I know (that's my baby)
I know karma like to follow us strong (sheesh)
I know millionaires that feel alone (sheesh)
Anytime I couldn't find God, I still could find myself through a song
Many find they life in a phone
Fuck it up, fuck it up
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up
You said I'd feel better if I just work hard without liftin' my head up
That left me fed up
You made me worry, I wanted my best version but you ignored me
Then changed the story
Then changed the story
Good energy in the room, drop the location, please
Antibiotic for the womb, when I'm frustrated, please
(Antibiotic for the womb, when I'm frustrated)
Tryna keep my good conscious in rotation
Thoughts in my head, they livin' there with no- (tryna keep my good)
I made a decision, never give you my feelings
Fuck with you from, fuck with you from a distance
Some put it on the Devil when they fall short
I put it on my ego, lord of all lords
Sometimes I fall for her, dawg
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (sheesh)
I love when you count me out (sheesh)
I love when you count me out
My name is in your mouth
Fuck it up, fuck it up (true, true)
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up
Miss Regrets, I believe that you done me wrong (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regrets, can you please exit out my home? (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regret, I think I'm better off alone (Miss Regrets)
(Miss Regret)
Miss Regret, I got these deep regrets (and I'm trippin' and fallin')
Some things I can't forget
Lord knows, I've tried my best
You said it's not my best
I came up out my flesh
Some things I must confess (ayy, ayy) (and I'm trippin' and fallin')
Spoke my truth, paid my debt (ayy, ayy)
Can't you see I'ma wreck? (Ayy, ayy)
Let me loose, I digress (ayy, ayy)
This is me and I'm blessed (ayy, ayy)
This is me and I'm blessed (ayy, ayy)
This is me and I'm blessed (ayy, ayy)
This is me and I'm blessed (ayy, ayy)
Anybody fightin' through the stress? (Ayy, ayy)
Anybody fightin' through the?
